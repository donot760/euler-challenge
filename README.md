# euler-challenge

### Motivation

Completing the Euler 100 coding challenge from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/) to get more experience with practical coding, as well as keep my coding skills sharp over the summer break.

### Project Structure

src contains all the solved problems. Each problem is in its own directory. Both the instructions and the solution are provided. I used the web interface and the provided test to solve the problems and am documenting the solutions here.

Some problems that were trickier required me to design my own test suite, which can be found in the "test" directory under a file with the problwm number. To run the test suite for a given problem, run `npx mocha -f problem_number` in the terminal.
