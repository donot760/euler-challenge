# euler-challenge
Completing the Euler 100 coding challenge from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/)

src contains all the solved problems. Each problem is in its own directory. Both the instructions and the solution are provided. I used the web interface and the provided test to solve the problems and am documenting the solutions here.
